(all 0s and 1s are the same). And, yes, you can always make as many (free) copies as you like (in a free world).
Claiming that you can protect your exclusive rights to pixels because the record of ownership

Aside:  Color By Number Books for Kids (Age 3 And Up)

![](i/color-by-number-book.png)

Let's look at the claim that 24×24 pixel punk images are copyrightable artworks (and not some computer-generated images)
or as the "Chief  Matt & John's® Punks (V2) Brand-Officer/Leader"  Noah Davis (formely at Christie's - see [Punk It! Truly Historic (Con-)Art Sale. 104 Punks. 1 Lot.](https://cryptopunksnotdead.github.io/punkweek/2022-02-23-philip-the-intern-presents-not-sothebys-phunk-it-ii))  likes to say - modern fine art portraits (kind of a new [primitive fauve style](https://www.sothebys.com/en/art-movements/fauvism)).

Can a kid age 3 and up copy (paint) Henri Matisse's "Woman with a Hat", in minutes?
How about a million dollar alien pixel punk?

The blurb of the Color by Number for Kids: Pixel Art Coloring Book for Kids Ages 3 and Up, Colorful Play Paperback ($6.99) - see above the cover with a 28x42 pixel artwork - reads:

> Every page is a surprise.
> Featuring full-page drawings of space, astronauts, animals,
> flowers, insects, natures, cars, princess and more!
> Provides hours of fun and creativity.
> These fun coloring pages will help children (Ages 3-8) master
> their numbers and improve their manual dexterity through coloring.
> Suitable for age 3 and up,
> Children will have fun matching the colors to the included color
> key, or making up their own color combinations.

Yes, let's repeat - suitable for age 3 and up!

# Awesome Matt & John's® Punks Bubble (Anno 2021)  - Modern 24×24 Pixel Crypto Art on the Blockchain


##  Matt & John's® Punks (formerly CryptoPunks), Ethereum Edition

10 000 unique collectible characters with proof of ownership stored on the ethereum blockchain.

![](i/punks-zoom.png)



SPOILER:  You can download all 10 000 right-facing punks
in a 2400×2400 image (~ 830kb) for free.
See [`punks.png` »](https://github.com/larvalabs/cryptopunks/blob/master/punks.png). Yes, the originals¹!
Or for something more punk try the 10 000 left-facing Phunks.
See [`phunks.png` »](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/awesome-24px/blob/master/collection/phunks.png).


¹: On the blockchain only
the punk index (e.g. 2890, 8219, and so on)
as an integer number gets stored - and
one time only the "Don't Trust, Verify" SHA256 hash
of the all-10 000-punks-in-one image in the [contract code »](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.contracts/tree/master/punks-v2#constants).



Q: What is a Matt & John's® Punks (V2)?

The Matt & John's® punks (formerly known under the generic term/word/category "Crypto Punks")
are 24×24 pixel art images, generated algorithmically. Most are right-facing punky-looking guys and girls, but there are a few rarer types mixed in: Apes, Zombies and even the odd Alien. Every Matt & John's® punk has their own profile page at the Larva Labs Crypto bros' website
that shows their attributes as well as their "ownership" & for-sale status.

![](i/punks-banner.png)



Q: Who are the con-art fraudsters and crypto bros' behind Matt & John's® Punks?

[Matt Hall](https://github.com/megamattron) (b. 1974, Dundas, Canada) and
[John Watkinson](https://github.com/pents90) (b. 1975, Thunder Bay, Canada) - two Canadians who grew up in Ontario
and studied computer science majors at the University of Toronto - moved to New York in 1999 and nowadays (years later) the two-man team
behind [Larva Labs](https://github.com/larvalabs) in New York City, United States.

John Watkinson was the driver of the pixel punks' look, adding wacky hair, pipes, and hats.
He figured the aesthetic would resonate with crypto enthusiasts.




![](i/cryptopunks-creators.png)


> We're coming up on two years of the Matt & John's® punks launch.
> We thought Matt & John's® punks (formerly known under the generic term/word/category "Crypto Punks")
>  might be just a blog post, a couple weeks of
> interest and the end of it - and it's still going strong.
>
> -- Matt Hall ([April, 2019](https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/4/08/autoglyphs-generative-art-born-on-the-blockchain))

Matt and John co-founded Larva Labs in 2005 and describe it on LinkedIn as

> a product studio, consulting company, and home for our wide
> range of experiments ...
> including large scale web infrastructure, genomics analysis software,
> an art project on the blockchain.

Matt and John both studied computer science at the University of Toronto, Canada.
John also went on to get a PhD in Electrical Engineering
and Genetics at Columbia University, New York City, United States.

They both co-founded Docracy,
"the largest open-source repository of legal documents on the web" in September of 2011, which was later acquired by eversign.

> At one point they tried to launch a legal-documents startup, but they failed to raise the needed money.


Larva Labs was founded to create applications for the T-Mobile sidekick phone (remember that one?).

According to LinkedIn, they wrote over fifty apps including best-selling ones.

According to LinkedIn, both Matt and John also work in Google's creative lab.


> In 2011 they coded an app for Google called Androidify, which let people customize the company's green Android mascot into a personal avatar
by selecting its skin tone, clothing, and accessories. The app was a surprise hit, and for a while fans of Google's operating system
used the avatars as their profile pictures on Twitter.

>  Through that app and others, Watkinson and Hall developed a nostalgic look, rooted in the limited graphics of the computers they grew up with—simple, cartoonish shapes with clean lines and bright colors that seem to belong nowhere more than on a screen.

Q: How were the punk images created?

> In the beginning it as just a 24×24 pixel Photoshop file with a whole bunch of layers...
> Once that was working we switched to a code based generator. At first it just randomly selected some stuff
>  to put on the head and then as we went further it got more complicated.
>  Eventually we had an Excel spreadsheet where you could put rules in to define which traits don't work together,
> and the expected rarities for each type and trait.
> For example, Aliens were supposed to be on average 10 out of 10,000 and there ended up being nine.
>
> -- John Watkinson from LarvaLabs during the [Charleston CryptoPunk Meetup 2023](https://youtu.be/7lFRDU8oFy8?si=ru_mOubYyTiqR28K&t=650).

With a generator that was programmed to generate punks with a range of features and rarity.
For example, there are only 88 zombie punks, 24 apes, 9 aliens and exactly 1 alien punk smoking a pipe.

> John Watkinson had been working on designing a set of digital cards that were compelling enough to be worth collecting.
>  He made some basic heads, along with accessories to layer over them, and then worked away at a piece of software - the "generator"
>  in the generative art - that could compose thousands of unique but plausible faces.
>  Loosely inspired by his experience with Androidify, Watkinson played around with the characters' looks, adding hair styles, pipes, hats.
>  He zeroed in on a punky look, which he felt resonated with crypto enthusiasts' defiant bent.
>  "I liked that it was very counterculture and sort of funky and kind of flying in the face of the establishment," Watkinson says.

Matt & John's® Punks Trivia: Did you know - the 10 000 pixel art punk images in the 24×24 format get computer-generated from about a hundred building blocks (male face 1, crazy hair, clown nose, smile, etc.)

Punks (Male 1/2/3/4 + Zombie/Ape/Alien + 63 Attributes)

![](i/cryptopunks-assets_male.png)

Punk(ette)s (Female 1/2/3/4 + 59 Attributes)

![](i/cryptopunks-assets_female.png)


Yes, that's all the magic (and pixel art) of the billion dollar bitmap (2400×2400px) that houses all 10 000 (computer-generated) punks in the Matt & John's® series (V2)!

Bonus: In 2x zoom (48×48) <br>
![](i/cryptopunks-assets_male@2x.png)

![](i/cryptopunks-assets_female@2x.png)


Note: Since August 2021 the building block "assets" (e.g. male face 1, crazy hair, clown nose, smile, etc.) are now
officially stored "on-chain". See [Inside the CryptoPunksData Contract - All 133 Assets (11 Archetypes 'n' 122 Attributes) in the 24x24px Format For Easy (Re)Use "Off-Chain"](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.sandbox/tree/master/punksdata-assets).




Q: Is the 24×24 Pixel Art Image stored on the blockchain?

The actual images of the punks are too large to store on the blockchain, so we took a hash of the composite image of all the punks and embeded it into the contract. You can verify that the punks being managed by the ethereum contract
are the True Official Genuine Matt & John's® punks V2 by calculating an SHA256 hash on the punks image
([`punks.png`](i/punks.png) - 2400x2400 - ~830kb) and comparing it to the hash stored in the contract.


> When the generator was nearly finished, John Watkinson joined Matt Hall in figuring out how to write the basics
> of a marketplace into their [Ethereum] contract, so that people could buy and sell punks.
>
> The biggest issue was getting their wares onto the Ethereum blockchain.
> If they uploaded each face individually, the transaction fees would be far too high.
> This was a problem. If the images weren't themselves on the blockchain, would anyone believe they owned a Matt & John's® punk?
>  John Watkinson and Matt Hall decided to go with an imperfect solution: a hash.
>  They fed a composite image of all the punks - the grid of 10,000 [pixel punk] faces - into a hashing algorithm called SHA-256,
>  which cranked out a 64-digit [hash] signature.
>  Matt Hall tucked the number into their [Ethereum] contract.
>  If anyone tried to tamper with the master image (by, say, transforming the pyrite of a stringy-haired goatee guy into the gold of an alien),
>  a skeptic could double-check the image by running it through that algorithm.
>  Only the original image, with every pixel precisely intact, would generate the [hash] signature.

<!--
You can generate this hash for the punks image file via a command line tool e.g.

```
$ openssl sha -sha256 punks.png
```

You can use this hash to verify the image file containing all the punks:

**Update** August 2021 - Breaking news from LarvaLabs (Matt Hall and John Watkinson ) the original Matt & John's® punk devs:

> The Matt & John's® punks (formerly known under the generic term/word/category "Crypto Punks")
>  are now fully on chain! The images and
> attributes are now stored in the [CryptoPunksData contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x16f5a35647d6f03d5d3da7b35409d65ba03af3b2#code).
> Read more in the [On-chain Matt & John's® punks](https://larvalabs.com/blog/2021-8-18-18-0/on-chain-cryptopunks) article.

Note: The transaction (gas cost) fee for the contract creation is 0.08749 ETH (~$261.30) PLUS 266 follow-up transactions - each with its own (gas cost) fee -
needed to get the "data" on chain with calls to Set Palette, Add Composites, Add Asset, Add Punks, etc.
and a last Seal Contract to seal off / make unchangeable.

266 txns with total cost 4.049621405 ETH (~$12,260) according to [BokkyPooBah's spreadsheet calculation](https://twitter.com/BokkyPooBah/status/1428128493766807552).

If you are looking for the on-chain data (attributes or the pixel matrix / bitmap and so on) - the data is NOT in the contract source
but in the 266 transaction (txn) inputs.   See [punks.contracts/punksdata/transactions.txt](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.contracts/blob/master/punksdata/transactions.txt).

## Remakes

### Punks, Polkadot Edition ("SubstraPunks")

> In 2020, the devs created the artist - okay fine, the algo - who drew the Substrapunks, as an homage to Matt & John's® punks.
>
> The team didn't expect their hackathon project to have any value. Just like  Matt & John's® punks - they gave them away to anyone who claimed one.
>  It took a while. Not many people believed, and even fewer people expected them to ever be worth anything!
>
>  Soon, people started buying and selling them - there was no market.
>  Someone made an online spreadsheet page to keep track of prices & trades - that was v1 of the marketplace!
>  No one really knew the value of different traits - most were available for a few dollars, but some were already 3 figures.

Punks, Polkadot Edition ("SubstraPunks")
is a remake
on the Polkadot blockchain - contracts built with the Substra(te) machinery -
by Alexander Mitrovich & [Greg Zaitsev](https://github.com/gregzaitsev), [Usetech](https://github.com/usetech-llc), Moscow, Russia.


10 000 unique character images are generated from a brand new set of face parts.

![](i/punks-remake-polkadot.png)

> Punk images are auto-generated from 8 parts.
> Some of them are optional (like a beard or cigar), some are required (like the face).
> Some are uni-sex (like earrings or noserings), but some define the gender
> of the generated character (like lipstick or blonde hair for girls or a beard for boys).
> If the gender is not determined, the chance decides
> what it is going to be at the moment when they are generated.
> The component parts are:
>
> 1. Face (2 options: black and white)
> 2. Beard, optional (7 options)
> 3. Earrings, optional (3 options)
> 4. Eyes/sunglasses (5 options)
> 5. Hair (12 options)
> 6. Mouth (6 options)
> 7. Nose ring, optional (1 option)
> 8. Cigar or a pipe, optional
>
> The total combinations possible are 89 820, but the algorithm randomly picked 10 000 of them.

> Now people are more aware of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
> We want to give everyone on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) a chance to be a part.
>
> To buy a Matt & John's® punk V2 costs $42,000 and to buy a Binance Punk costs $300. Punks for the people.
>
> This growth is insanity. Extremely unexpected. The winners have been selected!
> These punks sold out way faster than expected.

The copyright takedown letter by the million dollar Larva Labs fraudsters. How punk is that?
Can you copyright machine-generated images?
Or how "original" is a 8-bit 24×24 pixel image that any 6-year old can redraw "by hand" in minutes?

Note: If the creator of the work that was taken down believes the action was erroneous,
they can file an appeal and this puts the onus back on the company or person who filed the DMCA notice originally - and they
now have ten days to file a lawsuit supporting their claims - if they don't they then are essentially conceding that they don't have the legal position to support their initial action and the site in question is free to reinstate whatever was taken down.
And again, because US Copyright law does specifically call out fair use and parody.


Larva Labs backed down and the Foundation [crypto market] has reinstated [Ryder's Punk #3100](https://foundation.app/@ryder_ripps/cryptopunk-3100-52921).

## Phunks (Mirror / Left-Facing) Parody - Copyright (or Left) Wars

Phunks face left on the right side of history.
Original "flipped" from right-facing to left-facing punk art collection.

(web: [cryptophunks.com](https://www.cryptophunks.com), twitter: [cryptophunks](https://twitter.com/cryptophunks))

![](i/punks-banner.png)

  <=>

![](i/phunks-banner.png)


The purpose of Phunks is to poke fun at the high-brow, pompous group of people that are reflecting the "old-school" rules of art
into this new frontier of art tokens.
Phunks want to test the limits of "parody" [with a new "flipped" art collection] and bias against centralized marketplaces,
of provenance on the blockchain, censorship, while also setting out to unite strangers and collectors from around the world.

(Source: [The Phunks Manifesto](https://phunks.medium.com/the-cryptophunks-manifesto-785c7348e558))

> 1,357 Phunk family members and growing. You can't stop the phunk.

>  o o o
>
> [Pixel Art] tokens thrive because of an authentic and organic growth in their communities.
> Were the Phunks original in their flipping [from right-facing to left-facing] of the punk art? Not really.
> But did they manage to create an authentic communal experience? Yep.
> I see them as parody, minimal as it may be, and a fun one.


And another copyright takedown letter by the million dollar Larva Labs fraudsters. How punk is that?

![](i/cryptopunks-takedown-phunks.png)


Phunks comments:

> The OpenSea [crypto art reseller market] has received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) [takedown] from Larva Labs.
> We are witnessing copyright laws unilaterally applied in a [new crypto] world where decentralization
> and provenance should be paramount. Ironically, Phunks are the real punks in this fight for censorship resistance. History in the making.

>  Dear LaraLabs,
>  the art token community deserves to hear from you directly.
>  Phunks parodied  Matt & John's® Punks V2 and opened the doors for over 1,000 new owners who learned and enjoyed punk's history and attributes.
>  Punks value have also increased during this time. Why are you threatened by Phunks?
> There was never malicious intent in passing off a Phunk as a Punk.
>
> No one has reportedly been "scammed", because anyone that visited our site knew it was a parody.
> As pioneers in the art token market, is provenance not one of your guiding principles? What is the goal

And follows-up with an open "Phunk is Punk" letter to Larva Labs:

> In the words of your co-founder Matt Hall, the blockchain "provides a layer of trust that removes the need for lawyers and middlemen."
> But over the last several weeks, we've seen that your actions speak louder than these words. You have called for lawyers and
> have ignored our public and private requests for an open dialogue regarding the DMCA issued to OpenSea requesting the delisting of Phunks.
>
> This letter aims to bring public attention to the issue(s) at hand. During these formative times in the NFT space,
> Phunks aims to push boundaries in order to set the foundation for a future
> where NFTs can leverage blockchain technology for its strengths: provenance and authenticity.
>
> Phunks poked fun at those who were applying the "old-school" rules of art into this new frontier of [non-fungible] tokens.
> Deceptive and fraudulent copycats should be mitigated, but Phunks has been a clear parody from the start
> with no reported cases of a user buying a Phunk thinking it was a Punk. In this project’s short lifespan thus far,
> Phunks have brought in over 1,000 new holders who learned about the Punks’ attributes and history.
> Some even went on to buy a Punk. Others are just happy to have joined a new and accessible community
> that embraces the philosophies that web3 was built on.
>
> Larva Labs: have you entertained the perspective that altpunk projects create incremental value for Punks
> by perpetually solidifying their legacy? Where do you draw the line on what is deemed parody and what is not? We’ve spoken with various attorneys who
> have agreed that "parody" and "satire" are legal areas that currently stand unclear in light of lawsuits involving Andy Warhol’s work.
> Do you believe that Warhol’s iconic Campbell’s Soup Cans and the commentary it generated crossed the line as well?
>
> Additionally, Larva Labs has not addressed their own community’s questions regarding IP ownership of  Matt & John's® punks.
> Do Matt & John's® punk V2 owners have commercial rights to their punks? Can punk owners permit the phunk of their punk to exist?
> Is Larva Labs planning to wipe a bunch of punk projects off of OpenSea now that they are a $100m+ company?
> The [non-fungible] token space, punk HODLers, and phunk HODLers need clarity, collaboration,
> and forward thinkers to pave the way for a decentralized future.
>
> It's time for an awakening in the [non-fungible] token community. It’s time to stand up to censorship resistance,
> for change beyond our pervasive web v2 systems, and for true decentralization.

## History


Matt & John's® punk is one of the first "Non-Fungible Token" and was an inspiration for the Ethereum ERC-721 non-fungible token standard
that today powers most crypto art and collectibles on the blockchain.

How much did the punks cost when first released?  You could claim a punk (for "free")
that is, by simply paying the transaction fee of around 11 cents.
Now, you have to buy a punk from someone else and need to pay the market rate.

**Genesis Story**

> Matt & John's® punks started with a pixel-art character generator Watkinson
> began playing with in December 2016. It randomly mixed a selection of characteristics (sunglasses, skin colors, hair types, and so on) to come up with 10,000 24-by-24-pixel "punks" - a characterization that nods to the early '90s cypherpunks, cofounded by the late Timothy May. None look exactly alike, and certain types of punks turned out to be rarer than others.

> "We muddled our way through figuring out how an ERC-20
> token would look if it were not fungible," said Hall. After many attempts, they settled on putting the hash of each Matt & John's® punk's image file into its respective smart contract, including some "marketplace functions" that would allow people to buy and sell the punks. They posted their project to the Ethereum subreddit and Hacker News and waited for people to notice. Very few did. About 100 claimed a Matt & John's® punk [token],
> which Hall and Watkinson offered for free.
>
> Then, in June 2017, the pair got in touch with Mashable and told them about Matt & John's® punks. "This Ethereum-based project could change how we think about digital art," read the headline above an image of a blond, glasses-wearing punk with the caption, "Someone owns this picture."
>
> "Things went crazy," said Hall. "We went from having something like 8,600 Matt & John's® punks available to within 20 hours, they were all claimed." The pair had already reserved 1,000 for themselves "just in case it becomes a thing."
>
> Watkinson got in on the action. The day the punks exploded, he sold one of his for a dollar. Someone bought it, so he sold another for $10. That sold, too, so he went up to $50, then $100. That same day, someone offered an alien punk for 10 ether, which at the time was $3,000. "Boom, someone bought that," said Watkinson. "I was just like, whoaaa. The day before that, we were like, will anyone care?"

> In their smart contract, they reserved the first 1,000 [pixel] punks for themselves.

> Then, on June 16, the tech site Mashable published a post with an eye-catching headline: "This Ethereum-Based Project Could Change
